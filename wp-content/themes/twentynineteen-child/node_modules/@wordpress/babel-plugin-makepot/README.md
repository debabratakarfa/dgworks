# Babel Plugin Makepot

Babel plugin used to scan JavaScript files for use of localization functions. It then compiles these into a [gettext POT formatted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext) file as a template for translation. By default the output file will be written to `gettext.pot` of the root project directory. This can be overridden using the `"output"` option of the plugin.

```json
[ "@wordpress/babel-plugin-makepot", {
	"output": "languages/myplugin.pot"
} ]
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install @wordpress/babel-plugin-makepot --save-dev
